# Advent of Code 2022
I'm using this year's Advent of Code to play around in different languages and learn/try new things. I'm also prioritizing TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber so we'll see how far I get with this.

|Java|Days 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11|
|C|Day 1|
|Haskell|Day 2|
|Python|Day 4|
|C#|Day 5|
|C++|Day 6|
